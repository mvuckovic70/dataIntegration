Data integration in public sector

Advanced Usage of Integrated Data in Public Sector is an initial framework of a wider project considering various aspects of data integration in public administration domain. 

The main goal of this project is to integrate behavioral, psychological, educational, health, work, criminal, forensic, social media and other records into one data model, both robust and flexible, individually adjusted, yet systematized and categorized following certain rules, connected across horizontal and vertical public domain structures, well documented and referenced, with major objectives: guide, simplify, discover, predict, prevent.

Once integrated, data will become the subject of various data mining and machine learning explorations.

The subject of further work will be the implementation of various data integration mechanisms as well as diverse machine learning algorithms covering different public administration issues.
